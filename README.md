<p align="center">Coronate is a web app for managing Swiss-style chess tournaments.</p>

## 🧐 About

Coronate is a free alternative to pricey professional tournament software.
Anyone, even a tournament newbie with a locked-down public-access computer, can
use it to run their tournament.

## 🏁 Getting Started

These are the basic steps you'll need to follow to get a development copy of
Coronate running on your machine:

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 13. Coronate probably runs
on other versions too, but it's not tested on them.

### Installing

#### 1: Grab the code

For most people, the easiest method is to click the "Clone or Download" button
on [this project's GitHub homepage](https://github.com/johnridesabike/coronate).

If you have Git installed, you can also run:
```
git clone https://github.com/johnridesabike/coronate.git
```

If you want to make your own changes, then it's recommended to fork the
repository on GitHub and clone your forked version.

#### 2: Install the dependencies

Once you have a local copy of the code, run this command in the project's
directory to install its dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## 🎈 Usage

Coronate works completely in your local browser. Running it only requires two 
commands.

First run this to compile the ReScript source:
```
npm run build:res
```

Alternatively, you can run the compiler in watch mode:
```
npm run start:res
```

Then run this to start the app:
```
npm start
```

And then open this URL: `http://localhost:3000`.

Because it keeps your data in your browser's storage, be mindful that data loss
can happen unexpectedly depending on your settings. The app's "options" page has
a button to back up your data in an external file.

## 🔧 Running the tests

Just as with using the live version, you need to run `npm run build:res` first.

Then you can run the tests with the command:
```
npm test
```

## 🚀 Deployment 

To create an optimized version that can be uploaded to your own website, run:

```
npm run build
```
